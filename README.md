# Helicopter Game

This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling using deep learning models. The goal is to accurately classify ASL gestures, leveraging a combination of CNNs and Transformer models. The project achieved a top 10% ranking on the Kaggle leaderboard.  
     
## Features      
  
The ASL Fingerspelling Recognition system utilizes a two-part approach:
 
- Intuitive controls: Use the spacebar to navigate the helicopter.
- Dynamic obstacles with increasing difficulty.
- Background music during gameplay.
- Sound effects on collisions.
- In-game menu for Resume and Exit options.
- Post-collision menu with options to Restart or Exit the game.

## Overview

Helicopter Game is a simple yet engaging game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, players control a helicopter, avoiding obstacles to achieve a high score. It features background music, collision sounds, and a user-friendly menu system for starting, resuming, and exiting the game.
